TMAPP

This project is a prototype for a Task Management App (TMAPP) based on AngularJS and SemanticUI.

Simply run "index.html" in the app/ folder.

You can add comments and tasks, edit/re-assign tasks, add comments, and switch between user accounts.
Worker1 and worker2 can only view their own tasks, but manager can view all tasks.

There are default tasks included for example. You may delete them using the (X) delete button on each task.

This project is a WIP prototype and is not designed as a full-fledged, extensible application.
